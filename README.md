# Anti-Weeaboo MIT License

### [READ LICENSE TEXT](./LICENSE)

---

I love Open Source, and I want to give my software away to as many people as
possible. However, I refuse to let my work benefit those who support anime.

If you are not a weeaboo and don't actively support any weeaboos, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about. I will not pursue any legal claims against
you, even if my license text is poorly written.

If that is not enough for your organization, I can personally grant you an
unmodified MIT license. Please follow these steps:

- Email "anti-weeaboo-license@weeaboo.desu.moe" with information about the entity
  requesting an MIT license.
- The entity in question shall submit its entire unfiltered browsing history 
	by email for review.
- If accepted, a response will be given with an unmodified MIT license attached.
- If not, a response will simply not be given.

> Browsing history may range from browser history from every single computer to 
> ISP and DNS logs, depending on the entity in question.
